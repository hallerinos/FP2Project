\subsection{Determination of the Wavelength}
\label{toc:Wavelength}
For this task the magnetic field stays off. 
With help of the camera one can observe the interference pattern on the computer, the camera can be adjourned in order to measure distances between the rings. 
Figure~\ref{fig:InterferenceRings} shows the rings produced by the Fabry-P\'erot interferometer.

On the monitor one observes the unshifted interference rings for cadmium and for tin ($\lambda_\text{Cd,lit} = \SI{643.85}{\nano\metre}$, $\lambda_\text{Sn,lit} = \SI{636.23}{\nm}$) over ten orders. 
To improve the accuracy of the measurement, the position for each ring is determined by calculating the mean value of the left and the right end according to
\begin{align}
	x_i = \frac{x_{i,\text{left}} + x_{i,\text{right}}}{2} \hspace{0.5cm} \text{with} \hspace{0.5cm} \Delta x_i = \frac{1}{2}\sqrt{\left(\Delta x_{i,\text{left}}\right)^2 + \left(\Delta x_{i,\text{right}}\right)^2}\ .
\end{align}
This approach should deliver a more precise result for the center of the rings, since they are of different thickness. 
The uncertainty in each measured value is assumed to be $\Delta x = \SI{0.03}{\mm}$, even though the resolution of the scale is \SI{0.01}{\mm}. This is based on the fact, that the rings constrict for lower orders and therefore are more difficult to measure exactly.\\
To calculate the radius of each ring one needs to know the position of the center $x_0$. 
This can be achieved by measuring the first ring's position $x'$ left and right to the middle and taking the mean.
\begin{align}
	\begin{split}
		x_0 &= \frac{x'_{1,\text{left}} + x'_{1,\text{right}}}{2}\\
		\Delta x_0 &= \frac{1}{2}\sqrt{(\Delta x'_{1,\text{left}})^2 + (\Delta x'_{1,\text{right}})^2}\ .
	\end{split}
\end{align}  
To improve the measurement not only the first ring, but the first four rings were used and averaged afterwards.
The rings' radii now calculate according to
\begin{align}
	r_i = x_0 - x_i \hspace{0.5cm} \text{with an error of} \hspace{0.5cm} \Delta r_i = \sqrt{(\Delta x_0)^2 + (\Delta x_i)^2}\ .
\end{align}
Figure~\ref{fig:InterferenceRings} only shows the left side of the interference pattern. 
The right side could be made visible, if the optical elements in the course of beam were adjusted a little bit.
