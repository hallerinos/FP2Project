\subsection{Zeeman Effect in Longitudinal Direction at a Split-Up of 1/4}
\label{toc:ZeemanEffecAnalysis}
In order to determine the wavelength of the $\sigma^-$~- and $\sigma^+$~-~component, the Zeeman split-up should be 1/4 of the dispersion zone. 
Therefore the current is set to the specific value for each element according to table~\ref{tab:ObsZeeman}. 
The course of beam contains a quater-wave plate and a polarisation filter, which can be set to \ang{0} and \ang{90} to filter out each one of the circular components. 
At this time it is not possible to determine which one belongs to which angle, this is possible after doing the analysis.
However one expects the $\sigma^-$~-~line to shift to longer wavelengths and the $\sigma^+$~-~line to shift to shorter wavelengths.\\
For each element and each polarisation a measurement with the first five rings is done similarly to chapter~\ref{toc:Wavelength}. 
Again the center position is determined by averaging the ring's left and right position, now with two rings for each measurement.
