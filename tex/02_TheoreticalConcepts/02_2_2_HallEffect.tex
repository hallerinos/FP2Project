\subsubsection{Hall Effect and Measurement of Magnetic Fields}
\label{toc:HallEffect}
Magnetic fields can be measured using the Hall effect. 
It is based on the Lorentz force, which acts on charged particle (most often electrons) in an electrical conductor when moved vertically within the field. 
The electrons will be defelcted untill the force of the resulting electrical field is equally strong as the Lorentz force. 
The electrical potential can be measured as the Hall voltage
	\begin{align}
		U_{\text{H}} = A_{\text{H}}\frac{IB}{d}
	\end{align}
with the Hall constant $A_{\text{H}} = \frac{1}{nq}$. 
$I$ denotes the electric current, $n$ the charge carrier density, $d$ the thickness of the Hall sample and $q$ the amount of charge per carrier.
