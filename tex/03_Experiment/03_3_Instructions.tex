\begin{enumerate}
	\item{
	Record of the inductors Hysteresis Loop
	}
	\item{
	Review of the experiments setup
	}
	\item{
	Obtaining the singlet-line spectrum of the Cadmium- ($\lambda= \SI{643.85}{\nano\meter}$) and Tin-lamp ($\lambda= \SI{636.24}{\nano\meter}$)
	}
	\item{
	Determination of the wavelength by measuring the inner rings (up to $10^{\text{th}}$ order) without magnetic field
	}
	\item{
	Observation of the Zeeman-effect in longitudinal direction (adjustment of the ring-model via eye, always equidistant models) (only Cd-lamp)
	}
	\item{
	Determination of the magnetizing force, with a split-up of 1/4, 1/2 and 3/4 dispersion-zone (only Cd-lamp)
	}
	\item{
	Measuring the Zeeman-effect in longitudinal direction at a split-up of 1/4 dispersion-zone by measuring the 5 inner circles for $\sigma^{+}$, $\sigma^{-}$ separately (think highly of the numbering!) (only Cd-lamp)
	}
	\item{
	Determine the resolving capacity of the setup with the help of the Zeeman-effect and compare its value with the theoretical one
	}
	\item{
	Determine the specific charge of an electron 
	}
