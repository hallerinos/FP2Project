\subsubsection{Lambda/4 Wave Plate}
\label{toc:Lambda4}
A $\lambda$/4 wave plate is an optical device that is used in the course of beam. 
It exploits the effect of dispersion to delay electromagnetic waves (most often light) unequally along different axes. 
This can be used to turn light with circular polarisation into linearly polarised light and vice versa.
