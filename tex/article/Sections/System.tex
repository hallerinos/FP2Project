\section{System Considerations}
For the scope of this assignment, a system with $N$ particles in a box of volume $V$ and temperature $T$ is considered.
The closed box is placed in an external heat bath, hence the total energy is not fixed and the probability $P_i$ for a given State $\ket{i}$ with Energy $E_i$ and $\beta \mathrel{\mathop:}= \frac{1}{kT}$ is given by
\begin{align}
	P = \exp\left(-\beta E\right)~.
\end{align}
