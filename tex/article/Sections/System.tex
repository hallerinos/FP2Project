\section{System Considerations}
If not explicitly mentioned, the system's settings are as follows:\medskip\\
$N$ particles in a box of volume $V$ and temperature $T$ are considered.
The closed box is placed in an external heat bath, hence the total energy is not fixed and the probability $P_i$ for a given State $\ket{i}$ with Energy $E_i$ and $\beta \mathrel{\mathop:}= \frac{1}{kT}$ is given by
\begin{align}
	P_i = \frac{1}{Z}\exp\left(-\beta E_i\right)\text{, and }
	Z = \sum_k \exp\left(-\beta E_k\right).
\end{align}
Such an ensemble is called canonical or NVT.
