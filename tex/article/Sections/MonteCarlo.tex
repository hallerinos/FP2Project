\section{Monte Carlo Simulation}
It has been already mentioned, that MC approaches can be used to research many body systems which are not solvable analytically.
Numerical methods simplify this task, but they introduce other challenges - in most cases (especially for large scaling sizes), it is not possible to acces every single state.
However, for the explanation of the used algorithm, this can be neglected for now.

\subsection{Detailed Balance and the Metropolis Algorithm}
Consider the particle flow out of state $\ket{i}$
\begin{align}
	j^\text{out}_{i} \mathrel{\mathop:}= \sum_j P_i(t) W_{ij},
\end{align}
with jump probability $W_{ij}$ from state $\ket{i}$ to $\ket{j}$.
Analogue, the particle flow into state $\ket{i}$
\begin{align}
	j^\text{in}_{i} \mathrel{\mathop:}= \sum_j P_j(t) W_{ji}.
\end{align}
This yields to the master equation
\begin{align}
	\frac{\mathrm{d}P_i}{\mathrm{d}t} = 
		\sum_{j}\left(P_j(t)W_{ji} - P_i(t)W_{ij}\right),
\end{align}
which is fulfilled in the equilibrium by the stricter condition of detailed balance
\begin{align}
	P_iW_{ij} = P_jW_{ji}.
\end{align}
In other words - the system moves towards equilibrium if detailed balance is enforced.
The key of success is to choose $W_{ij}$ such that detailed balance is fulfilled.
